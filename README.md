👋 Hey, I’m **Vrushal Mehta**
=============================

> I build apps, play with AI, and sometimes break stuff — just to fix it better 😉

### 🧠 About Me

Aspiring Python Backend Developer with around 1 year of hands-on, project-based experience building
backend systems and REST APIs. Experienced with FastAPI, Flask, databases (MySQL, MongoDB,
Firebase), and API-driven AI integrations. Seeking my first full-time on-site role to gain industry
exposure, strengthen full-stack skills, and grow under mentorship in a collaborative development
environment.

### 🚀 What I’m Up To

*   ⚙️ **Tweaking** [**PassNext**](#) — my sidekick that remembers passwords so I don’t have to 😏
    
*   📱 Diving deep into **OS**, **System Design**, and **AI / ML**
    
*   💡 Building, breaking, testing, and learning — on repeat
