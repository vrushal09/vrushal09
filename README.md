👋 Hi, I’m Vrushal Mehta
======================

Backend-leaning developer with a strong interest in systems, data, and applied AI.  
I enjoy building real-world products, understanding how they work internally, and improving them through iteration.

### 🧠 About Me

I’m a hands-on developer with around **1 year of project-based experience**, working on production-style applications and internal tools. My work primarily focuses on **backend development, APIs, databases, and data-driven features**.

I’ve built and shipped projects using **FastAPI, Flask, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase**, and various third-party APIs. Alongside development, I actively explore **system design concepts, performance trade-offs, and scalability considerations**.

I believe in learning by building — breaking things, fixing them, and refining them until they work better.
