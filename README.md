👋 Hey, I’m **Vrushal Mehta**
=============================

> I build apps, play with AI, and sometimes break stuff — just to fix it better 😉

### 🧠 About Me

I’m Vrushal Mehta, an aspiring System Software Developer with a strong foundation in Android
development and Full Stack Development. I completed a 4-week design internship at CityNect, where I
enhanced social media engagement by 15%. I’ve also built several projects that have gained 150+
active users. Alongside development, I possess creative expertise in 3D Animation and Motion Design,
allowing me to craft applications that not only perform efficiently but also deliver a seamless and visually
engaging user experience.

### 🚀 What I’m Up To

*   ⚙️ **Tweaking** [**PassNext**](#) — my sidekick that remembers passwords so I don’t have to 😏
    
*   📱 Diving deep into **OS**, **System Design**, and **AI / ML**
    
*   💡 Building, breaking, testing, and learning — on repeat
