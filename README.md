👋 Hey, I’m **Vrushal Mehta**
=============================

> I build apps, play with AI, and sometimes break stuff — just to fix it better 😉

### 🧠 About Me

I’m a hands-on developer with around 1 year of project-based experience building real-world systems.I enjoy working on backend logic, APIs, databases, and AI-powered features. I’ve built and shippedprojects using FastAPI, Flask, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, and various API-driven integrations.

I like understanding how things work under the hood — from system design to performance trade-offs —and I’m constantly learning by building, experimenting, and iterating.

### 🚀 What I’m Up To

*   ⚙️ **Tweaking** [**PassNext**](#) — my sidekick that remembers passwords so I don’t have to 😏
    
*   📱 Diving deep into **Operating Systems**, **System Design**, and **AI / ML**
    
*   💡 Building, breaking, testing, and learning — on repeat
