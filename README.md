👋 Hey, I’m **Vrushal Mehta**
=============================

> I build apps, play with AI, and sometimes break stuff — just to fix it better 😉

### 🧠 About Me

I’m a **B.Sc IT student** who loves blending **tech and creativity**.Most days, you’ll find me tinkering with code, designing slick UIs, or bringing random AI ideas to life.I like making things that **work smart, look good,** and maybe even make someone go “whoa.”

### 🚀 What I’m Up To

*   ⚙️ **Tweaking** [**PassNext**](#) — my sidekick that remembers passwords so I don’t have to 😏
    
*   📱 Diving deep into **OS**, **System Design**, and **AI / ML**
    
*   💡 Building, breaking, testing, and learning — on repeat
